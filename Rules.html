<h1 > Rules: </h1>
<h3> Objective: To have the most points at the end of the game.</h3>

<p > You draw cards of 7 different colours (<span class="text-danger">6 if you are playing with three or two players </span>) and at the end of the game you score the <span class="text-danger"> three </span>  colors of which you have the most cards according to the following table: </p>

<table width="200" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1 card:</td>
      <td>1 point</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2 cards:</td>
      <td>3 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 cards:</td>
      <td>6 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4 cards:</td>
      <td>10 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 cards:</td>
      <td>15 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6 cards:</td>
      <td>21 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7 or more cards:</td>
      <td>21 points</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The colours that are not among the top three colours <span class="text-warning"> discount </span> you points according also to the previous table.
For example if you have:

<ul>
	<li>
		2 green cards
	</li>
	<li>
		2 light blue cards
	</li>
	<li>
		4 red cards
	</li>
	<li>
		5 orange cards
	</li>
	<li>
		5 yellow cards
	</li>
	<li>
		6 violet cards
	</li>
	<li>
		7 brown cards
	</li>
</ul>

You would score:

<h5> + 21 (7 brown cards)</h5> 
<h5> + 21 (6 violet cards)</h5> <h5> + 15 (5 yellow cards)</h5><h5>  - 15 (5 orange cards)</h5><h5> - 10 (4 red cards)</h5><h5>  - 3 (2 light blue cards)</h5> <h5> - 3 (2 green cards)</h5><h5>  = 26 points</h5>


<p>Rainbow cards count as any colour, and "+2" cards simmply add points and don't count towards any colour.</p>

<h5> Turn development:</h5>

<p> On your turn you have two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Draw a card from the deck and place it next to <span class="text-danger"> any</span> row (there are as many rows as players playing) </li>
	<li> Choose a row and take all cards from that row. That row is unavailable until the end of the current round. </li>
	<li> You can't place cards on a row that has 3 cards already. </li>
	<li> When all rows are full (i.e., have 3 cards on it), your only option is to take a row. When all rows are taken, the round ends. </li>
	<li> Each round (except for the first one) starts with the last player to play in the previous round. </li>
	
</ul>
